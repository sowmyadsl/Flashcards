    <h1>Learning JS and jQuery </h1>
    <h3 id="h-java">JavaScript</h3>
    <p id="def-java">JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.</p>
    <h3 id="h-op">Operators</h3>
    <p id="def-op">+, -, *, /, and % are called operators. An operator is a special character (or characters) that indicates an action to be performed.</p>
    <h3 id="h-var">Variables</h3>
    <p id="def-var">an element, feature, or factor that is liable to vary or change.</p>
    <h3 id="h-var-name">Variable naming conventions</h3>
    <p id="def-var-name">In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>
    <h3 id="h-fun">Functions</h3>
    <p id="def-fun">A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.</p>
    <h3 id="h-meth">Methods</h3>
    <p id="def-meth">In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects. The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object. A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element). A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).</p>
    <h3 id="h-arg">Arguments</h3>
    <p id="def-arg"> The arguments object is a local variable available within all functions. You can refer to a function's arguments within the function by using the arguments object. This object contains an entry for each argument passed to the function, the first entry's index starting at </p>
    <h3 id="h-para">Parameters</h3>
    <p id="def-para">a numerical or other measurable factor forming one of a set that defines a system or sets the conditions of its operation.</p>
    <h3 id="h-ret">Return</h3>
    <p id="def-ret">In JavaScript, return statements cease execution in a function and return a value to the caller; JavaScript functions require an explicit return statement for returning the result of an expression (the value) from a function. When a return statement is not present, the interpreter automatically returns undefined.</p>
    <h3 id="h-cha">Chaining methods</h3>
    <p id="def-cha">Easily Create Chainable (Cascading) Methods for Expressiveness. ... — Understand JavaScript's “this” With Ease. — JavaScript Objects in Detail. Chaining Methods, also known as Cascading, refers to repeatedly calling one method after another on an object, in one continuous line of code.</p>
    <h3 id="h-str">Strings</h3>
    <p id="def-str">The String global object is a constructor for strings, or a sequence of characters.</p>
    <h3 id="h-boo">Booleans</h3>
    <p id="def-boo">a binary variable, having two possible values called “true” and “false.”.</p>
    <h3 id="h-un">Undefined</h3>
    <p id="def-un">not clear or defined.</p>
    <h3 id="h-Nan">Nan</h3>
    <p id="def-Nan">NaN property is a value representing Not-A-Number</p>
    <h3 id="h-esc">Escape</h3>
    <p id="def-esc">This function makes a string portable, so it can be transmitted across any network to any computer that supports ASCII characters.</p>
    <h3 id="h-alert">Alert</h3>
    <p id="def-alert">The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.</p>
    <h3 id="h-com">Comments</h3>
    <p id="def-com">To create a single line comment in JavaScript, you place two slashes "//" in front of the code or text you wish to have the JavaScript interpreter ignore. When you place these two slashes, all text to the right of them will be ignored, until the next line.</p>
    <h3 id="h-jq">jQuery</h3>
    <p id="def-jq">jQuery is a concise and fast JavaScript library that can be used to simplify event handling, HTML document traversing, Ajax interactions and animation for speedy website development. jQuery simplifies the HTML's client-side scripting, thus simplifying Web 2.0 applications development.</p>
    <h3 id="h-attr">Attributes</h3>
    <p id="def-attr">a piece of information that determines the properties of a field or tag in a database or a string of characters in a display.</p>
